Building AI Powered Solution for Assisting Visually Impaired Individuals

Problem Statement
This project aims to leverage Generative AI to assist visually impaired individuals in perceiving and interacting with their surroundings.
Visually impaired individuals often face challenges in understanding their environment, reading visual content, and performing tasks that rely on sight.

There is a need for an intelligent, adaptable, and user-friendly solution that provides:

Real-time scene understanding.
Text-to-speech conversion for reading visual content.
Object and obstacle detection for safe navigation.
Personalized assistance for daily tasks.

Task

Develop an AI-powered application using Streamlit that provides assistive functionalities through image analysis. The application should allow users to upload an image and implement at least two of the following features:
Real-Time Scene Understanding
Generate descriptive textual output that interprets the content of the uploaded image, enabling users to understand the scene effectively.
Text-to-Speech Conversion for Visual Content
Extract text from the uploaded image using OCR techniques and convert it into audible speech for seamless content accessibility.
Object and Obstacle Detection for Safe Navigation
Identify objects or obstacles within the image and highlight them, offering insights to enhance user safety and situational awareness.
Personalized Assistance for Daily Tasks
Provide task-specific guidance based on the uploaded image, such as recognizing items, reading labels, or providing context-specific information.

Implementation Requirements
Langchain, Streamlit, Google Generative AI
